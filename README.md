# Number Guesser

#### A Mod 1 paired project intended to develop skills around:
* Semantic HTML
* Clean CSS styles
* DRY JavaScript
* Well-organized code
* DOM manipulation including:
    * Adding, removing & updating elements
* Event bubbling
    * Event delegation

#### In this project we used CSS3 and HTML5 to build an app to match a static comp.  We then used JavaScript to add functionality to create a number guesser game.
